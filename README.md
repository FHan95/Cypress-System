# Cypress System

A program that encompasses HTML, PHP, and SQL.

The Cypress System aims to provide users with the ability to report problems that they notice on the streets. Administrators are given the authority to change the status, problem name, description, and priority of the reports.

The databases play a crucial element to the program. User credentials are compared to those stored in the login database which not only grant access to administrative authority, but also helps in preventing duplicate usernames during sign up. The report database keeps track of all the problems reported and displays these to the adminstrator. In addition, it interacts with the adminstrator by allowing for specific edits to be performed.
